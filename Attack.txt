Test set_accuracy:

Valid Input:

Input: "75" (a valid input between 50 and 100).
Expected Output: The program should set the accuracy to 75 and display "Successfully changed accuracy to 75."
Invalid Input (Below Range):

Input: "30" (an input below the valid range).
Expected Output: The program should display "Invalid Input. Input must be between 50-100 inclusive."
Invalid Input (Above Range):

Input: "110" (an input above the valid range).
Expected Output: The program should display "Invalid Input. Input must be between 50-100 inclusive."
Test set_attack_type:

Valid Input (Fire):

Input: "1" (to set the attack type to "Fire").
Expected Output: The program should set the attack type to "Fire" and display "Successfully changed type to Fire."
Valid Input (Grass):

Input: "2" (to set the attack type to "Grass").
Expected Output: The program should set the attack type to "Grass" and display "Successfully changed type to Grass."
Valid Input (Water):

Input: "3" (to set the attack type to "Water").
Expected Output: The program should set the attack type to "Water" and display "Successfully changed type to Water."
Invalid Input (Below Range):

Input: "0" (an input below the valid range).
Expected Output: The program should display "Invalid Input. Input must be between 1-3 inclusive."
Invalid Input (Above Range):

Expected Output: The program should display "Invalid Input. Input must be between 1-3 inclusive."
Test set_power:

Valid Input (Accuracy = 75):

Input: "75" (setting accuracy to 75).
Expected Output: The program should calculate the power based on the given accuracy and display the resulting power.
Valid Input (Accuracy = 50):

Input: "50" (setting accuracy to the minimum value).
Expected Output: The program should calculate the power based on the given accuracy and display the resulting power.
Valid Input (Accuracy = 100):

Input: "100" (setting accuracy to the maximum value).
Expected Output: The program should calculate the power based on the given accuracy and display the resulting power.
